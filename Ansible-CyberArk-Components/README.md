# Deploying CyberArk components with Ansible

In this directory are all the files I used to let my CentOS workstation use an Ansible Control node to install and configure a CPM, PVWA and PSM. I test over and over using snapshots of the components and the Vault. 

The prerequisites for using the stuff in this directory are:

Python modules
    -pywinrm
    -ansible
    -jmespath

Ansible installed
Proper hosts file for Ansible
DNS server for resolution

ZIPs of the CPM, PVWA and PSM install
