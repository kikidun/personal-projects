# personal-projects

Welcome to my personal repo! In here I'd like to practice git, Ansible, ELK, Docker, and anything else that catches my interest. 

I aim to get better at cloud automation and increase my knowledge of DevOps tools and methodologies through hands on use of said tools and methodologies.
